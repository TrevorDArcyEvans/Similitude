## 1 General Information

Duplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.
Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks within multiple C/C++/Java 
source files.

### 1.1 Sample Output

----------------------------------------------------------------

```
src\engine\geometry\simple\TorusGeometry.cpp(56)
src\engine\geometry\simple\SphereGeometry.cpp(54)
	pBuffer[currentIndex*size+3]=(i+1)/(float)subdsU;
	pBuffer[currentIndex*size+4]=j/(float)subdsV;
	currentIndex++;
	pPrimitiveBuffer->unlock();

src\engine\geometry\subds\SubDsGeometry.cpp(37)
src\engine\geometry\SkinnedMeshGeometry.cpp(45)
    pBuffer[i*size+0]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3];
    pBuffer[i*size+1]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+1];
    pBuffer[i*size+2]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+2];
```

### 1.2 Usage

```
NAME
        Duplo 0.3.0 - duplicate source code block finder


SYNOPSIS
        duplo [OPTIONS] [INTPUT_FILELIST_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
        Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large
        C/C++/Java/C#/VB.Net software systems.

        -ml minimal block size in lines (default is 4)
        -mc minimal characters in line (default is 3)
            lines with less characters are ignored
        -ip ignore preprocessor directives
        -d  ignore file pairs with same name
        -xml output file in XML
        INTPUT_FILELIST_FILE file with list of source files
        OUTPUT_FILE output file

VERSION
       0.3.0

### 1.3 Feedback and Bug Reporting

Please send Feedback and Bug Reports to:

cammann@giants.ch

### 1.4 Source files text file generation

Generate a list of all files of a directory with:

Windows
```
dir /s /b /a-d *.cpp *.h > myFiles.lst
dir /s /b /a-d *.cs > myFiles.lst
```

UNIX
```
 find -name "*.cpp" > cppList.lst
 find -name "*.h" > includeList.lst
 cat cppList.lst includeList.lst > all.lst
```

## 2 System Requirements

Duplo needs about two times the memory of the total source code size. So if
your Source code is about 120MB it requires 240MB.

## 5 Background

Duplo uses the techniques described in the paper 
[A Language Independent Approach for Detecting Duplicated Code](Duca99bCodeDuplication.pdf)
from Stéphane Ducasse, Matthias Rieger and Serge Demeyer to detect duplicated code blocks.

## 8 Porting to .NET Core 6
As indicated at the start, this was a line by line conversion from C++ to C#
In general, this was relatively straightforward due to the high degree of
similarity between the languages.

Initial runtime performance was incredibly poor and profiling quickly revealed
some bottlenecks:
1. _matrix_ was reset by iterating over whole array and individually resetting
  each element
* C++ version used `memset` which writes directly to memory
* .NET version was changed to allocate a fresh _matrix_
2. object comparison went through several layers of indirection
* C++ version uses vtable directly
* .NET version probably uses reflection or something simlarly slow
* fix is to directly compare _Hash_ values

Current runtime performance is still very slow, about 2 orders of magnitude
slower than the C++ version.
